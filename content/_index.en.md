## Final project : A restaurant inventory

You’ll be the manager of a restaurant. The graphical UI will show the main room and the stock of ingredient, alongside some additional windows for recipe and what to buy (+ other if time for that).  

 In the end, the user should be able to click on a table, assign a meal for said table, and the application will check if the stock can handle such command. Additional feature such as replenishing stocks and following the monetary balance of the restaurant could be cool.
